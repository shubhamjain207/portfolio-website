            Hi, my name is Shubham Jain. I am just a normal guy who loves programming which is and always will remain my very first love, photography and creating art, as I believe that art is a beautiful way to express emotions and ideas.<br><br>
            Currently I am a Master's student studying Computer Science in University of Leicester, England. 

        </p>

        <p>
            I sometimes play chess and I have a soft spot for biographical films like The Social Network, The Imitation Game, The Man Who Knew Infinity, The Aviator,etc.<br> <br>These movies inspire me by showcasing the stories of remarkable individuals who have left a lasting impact on the world and I also get to know about the strategies they accumulated to do wonders.

        </p>

        <p>
            I have a deep appreciation for the music of the 1980s, especially rock and jazz.
